publish_to: "none"
# Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/icons/
        # - assets/design_course/
        - assets/fitness_app/
        # - assets/hotel/
        - assets/introduction_animation/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: WorkSans
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
                weight: 500
              - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-SemiBold.ttf
                weight: 600
              - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Bold.ttf
                weight: 700
        - family: Roboto
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Medium.ttf
                weight: 400
        - family: MyIcon
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/iconfont.ttf
